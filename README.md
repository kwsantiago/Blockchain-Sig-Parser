# Blockchain Signature Parser
This script outputs signatures corresponding to public keys from raw blockchain signatures.  

-Edit the parseSigs.sh file for certain paramters you might want, such as minumum and maximum signatures for a public key to have, or for a certain amount of public keys to be displayed.  

**How to Use**  
-Run this command to get a folder called ```Signatures``` that contains the signatures of each corresponding public key.  ```./parseSigs.sh test.log```

This can be tested on test.log which are signatures collected from the Bitcoin blockchain.
